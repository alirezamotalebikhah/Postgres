## 📚 What You'll Learn

This tutorial series and repository will teach you:

- **PostgreSQL Fundamentals**: Understanding relational databases and PostgreSQL
- **Python Database Integration**: Connecting Python applications to PostgreSQL
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping for efficient database operations
- **Database Design**: Creating well-structured database schemas
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations in Python
- **Advanced Queries**: Complex database queries and relationships
- **Best Practices**: Professional database management techniques

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system
- **PostgreSQL** database server (optional - can use SQLite for practice)
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Text editor or IDE of your choice

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alirezamotalebikhah/Postgres.git
   cd Postgres
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install sqlalchemy
   pip install psycopg2-binary  # PostgreSQL adapter
   ```

3. **Optional: Set up PostgreSQL**
   ```bash
   # If you have PostgreSQL installed locally
   createdb tutorial_db
   ```

   *Note: The tutorial also demonstrates using SQLite for practice, so PostgreSQL installation is optional.*

## 🛠️ Running the Examples

Each lesson folder contains runnable Python scripts:

```bash
# Navigate to a specific lesson
cd lesson-04

# Run the example
python main.py

# Or run with detailed output
python -u main.py
```

## ❗ Common Setup Issues

### **Database Connection Errors**
```python
# Make sure your connection string is correct
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"

# For SQLite (no setup required)
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///tutorial.db"
```

### **Import Errors**
```bash
# Ensure SQLAlchemy is installed
pip install sqlalchemy

# For PostgreSQL support
pip install psycopg2-binary
```
